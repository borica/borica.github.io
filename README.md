# Tiago Bori√ßa

Hello ! My name is Tiago and i am a passionated web developer. Over the past years i spent my time learning and working in technologies for the web and i plan on keep doing it.

## My goal
My goal is to build comprehensive apps, with sustainability and passion. I'm always into something new and up for a challenge. I want to work in a place where i can grow alongside with the company and where i can work with inspiring people to be noticed and also to recognize them.

## Philosophy
Build a program that runs/compiles is not too hard nowadays, what really is rare is to see a good understandable code. I want to build simple, efficient and easy to read code, whatever the platform i'm working in. 
I bet you already came across a block of code in some project you've worked on that you could not understand properly what it meant.

## Experience

I've been messing around with computers since i was a child, so it was no surprise when i decided i wanted to work with something related to that. Currently i'm a computer technician and in the course of the last two years i've been coding in PHP and JAVA languages for two companies.
